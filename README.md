# Broadcast Token Naming System (BTNS)

This is the official repository for Broadcast Token Naming System (BTNS). 

The BTNS operates on the Counterparty platform using the `broadcast` feature. However, the BTNS is NOT officially endorsed by the Counterparty project, and is a personal hobby project. 

more info coming soon... busy writing indexer :)

If you would like to contribute a spec to the BTNS, please contact me at <j-dog@j-dog.net>
