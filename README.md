# Broadcast Token Naming System (BTNS)

This is the official repository for Broadcast Token Naming System (BTNS). 

The **`BTNS`** operates on the **`Counterparty`** platform using the `broadcast` feature. 

**`BTNS`** and **`BTNS-420`** are **NOT** _officially_ endorsed by the **`Counterparty`** project. 

**`BTNS-420`** was copied, almost entirely, from the existing **`Counterparty`** platform features. 

This is a personal hobby project, to allow for experimentation with additional token features and functionality.


# Disclaimer 
`BTNS` is a bleeding-edge experimental protocol to play around with token functionality on **`Bitcoin`** and **`Counterparty`**. This is a hobby project, and  I am **NOT** responsible for any losses, financial or otherwise, incurred from using this experimental protocol and its functionality. 

Science is messy sometimes... _**DO NOT**_ put in funds your not willing to lose!
